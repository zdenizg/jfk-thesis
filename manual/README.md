# Manual Ground Truth (OCR Evaluation)

This folder contains my individual contribution to the thesis project: a manually curated index of document-level characteristics used to support OCR accuracy evaluation.

The original PDFs and manually transcribed text files are not included in this repository.
They are stored in shared project storage and were used locally for annotation only.
